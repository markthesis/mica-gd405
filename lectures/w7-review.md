Answer the questions below:

- What does `setup()` function do? What does `draw()` function do?
- What is an algorithm?
- When do we use `//comments`?
- How do we track mouse position?
- What is the value of the variable, width?
```
size(800, 600);
rect(400, 200, 100, 100);
```
- Use system variables for the ellipse x and y positions instead of the hard-coded numbers.
```
size(600, 400);
// draw ellipse in the middle of screen
ellipse(300, 200, 100, 100);
```
- What is the value 20 for in the `fill()`?
```
size(400, 400);
fill(255, 0, 0, 20);
ellipse(50, 50, 50, 50);
```
- What does `random()` function do?
- What range of values do we get?Give two examples for each.
```
random(255);
random(50, 100);
random(0, 1);
```
