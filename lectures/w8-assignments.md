## Main assignment

- Finish your interactive type poster assignment.
- Use the interactions and animation in meaningful ways. Do not just show off your skills but relate them to the contents you are working with.
- Find some excuses to try out new techniques you have learned (for loop, object, array, etc.)
- Do your own research in learning new concepts (more interactions? audio? video? web feed?)
