# Week 10 assignments

## Tutorial

One of the best ways to learn is to teach or help other people. This week's assignment is for you to write or record a tutorial on a topic related to generative typography that has not been covered in class. 

- Write a tutorial with code examples and post on Trello. (Look at [Formatting help](http://help.trello.com/article/821-using-markdown-in-trello) to find out how to insert code on Trello cards.) Or, you could, alternatively, record a video tutorial and post a link on Trello.
- Find an interesting topic that hasn't been covered in class, and share it with us. It could be something you will learn for the final project, or something you have already tried in any prior assignments. Share your tips & techniques. Share your mistakes.
- It does not have to be overly complex, but do not pick something that is too easy or basic. Challenge yourself a little, but do not choose something you don't understand. Also, don't just copy and paste what's already out there. If you find something interesting, first make it your own and add your own contents to it.
- It should take no more than 10-15 minutes to follow your tutorial.
- When we meet next time, we will try out your tutorials as small groups.
