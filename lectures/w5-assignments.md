# Week 5 assignments

## Part 1: develop your type design

As we continue to think about the "constructed" letterforms and the system, this week, I would like you to find your own direction to develop your design further based on what you already have. This could include designing more letters, adding more interactions and parameters, etc.

Just to give you a heads up, our Final Project (starting week 10) will explore types that respond to external conditions and it can be based upon the design you've been working on, so please take enough time now to fully explore different concepts, visuals and techniques.

### Part 2: Let's put our type to use!

We will see how our type design holds up in different contexts by making a poster. We also have the magnetic boards scheduled for displaying class work from Feb. 26.

- Create a poster that showcases what your type design can do.
- As the poster is a static medium, animation/interactions will not work on paper. Instead, think about other effective ways of showing your types' versatility and flexibility. For example, use repetitions and small multiples. What is interesting about designing programmatically? You can think of this poster image as a promotional material for your type.
- If you export PDF out of Processing, then you can open the file in Illustrator and make fine adjustments.
- Use 11 x 17 inch format. Vertical orientation only.
- Upload the finalized poster image file (PDF or PNG) on Google Drive.
- Print and bring the final poster on 11 x 17 inch paper. Again, in vertical orientation.
