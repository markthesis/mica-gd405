# Week 5 assignments

## Video Lessons
Watch from 7.1 to 7.6 from [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bI1SlcCRfLH79HZrFAtBvX)

## Reading
Post a short summary *and* your thoughts on the journal:

### Part 2
For part 2, you may or may not use the same program from the part 1 as the interaction is not required. You could instead create a separate program and it may give you more flexibility. After all, what we are creating is *a system*, so there can be many different applications.

- 10 different static compositions showcasing the capability/flexibility of your computational type system. Show different parametric combinations - a range of expressions. Use phrases or sentences of your choice. Keep the background white.
- Another image that contains all the letters you have designed so far. Keep the background white.
- Try to export high-resolution images.
- Upload all the images on Google Drive Week 4 folder.
- Codepen link should be posted on Google Drive.

*Feel free to use Processing to export high quality images.*





## Type design

1. Design all twenty six characters.
1. Set your sketch size to 900 (w) x 600 (h) pixels. i.e. `createCanvas(900, 600);`
1. clean up your code: commenting, indentation, line breaks, optimize.
1. Look back at your design: consistency, common parameters, details, range of expressions.
1. Using your type design, create an **interactive** type specimen/poster in p5.js. The idea of the specimen/poster here is loose. It's up to you how you want to treat this. 
1. Consider how the user may use your software. You can showcase the capabilities of your parametric design and/or place it in a context to help users understand better.
1. Post the sketch (the entire folder) on Google Drive.

### Further learning
- [Pop up view within the same sketch](http://codepen.io/cdaein/pen/mRvZaQ?editors=0010)
- [Multiple scene control](http://codepen.io/cdaein/pen/BpMgEg?editors=0010)
- [Transformation in p5](http://genekogan.com/code/p5js-transformations/) - translate, scale, etc.
- [Transformation in p5](http://creative-coding.decontextualize.com/transformations-and-functions/) - another tutorial.
- [Transformation in Processing](https://processing.org/tutorials/transform2d/) - the concept is the same as p5.
