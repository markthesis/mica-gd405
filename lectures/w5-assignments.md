# Week 5 assignments

## Part 1: develop your type design

As we continue to think about the "constructed" letterforms and the system, this week, I would like you to find your own direction to develop your design further based on what you already have. This could include designing more letters, adding more interaction and parameters, etc.

Just to give you a heads up, our Project 1 will be based upon your own type design, so please take enough time to 

- 10 different static compositions showcasing the capability/flexibility of your computational type system. Show different parametric combinations - a range of expressions. Use phrases or sentences of your choice. Keep the background white.
- Another image that contains all the letters you have designed so far. Keep the background white.
- Try to export high-resolution images.
- Upload all the images on Google Drive Week 4 folder.
- Codepen link should be posted on Google Drive.

### Part 2: Let's put our type to use!

We have the magnetic boards reserved for displaying class work from Feb. 26. 


1. clean up your code: commenting, indentation, line breaks, optimize.
1. Look back at your design: consistency, common parameters, details, range of expressions.
1. Using your type design, create an **interactive** type specimen/poster in p5.js. The idea of the specimen/poster here is loose. It's up to you how you want to treat this. 
1. Consider how the user may use your software. You can showcase the capabilities of your parametric design and/or place it in a context to help users understand better.
1. Post the sketch (the entire folder) on Google Drive.
