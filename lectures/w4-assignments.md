## Type Design
We will continue with your type design from the last week.

1. Refine your design and codes.
1. Restructure your code so that it now uses *functions* for each letter. (refer back to the lecture notes on type setting with functions)
1. Keep working with the parameters. Be flexible so that it can respond to different situations.
1. Design six additional letters. (by next week, you should have at least 16 letters.)
1. Apply conditional statements and keyboard interactions in your code so that the letters can be typed.
1. Animation is not required in this assignment.
1. Post the Codepen link on Google Drive Week 4.
