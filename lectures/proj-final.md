# Final Project

The final project is an open project as long as it is related to generative typography. Look back at everything you have done so far - from sketches, journal, assignments to any questions.

You may make it as practical and functional, or as experimental and unconventional as you want, but make sure you are not just replicating an existing project (it is so easy to just copy and paste someone else's codes). 

Define your own goals. What are you trying to achieve with your design? Your goal should be realistic. You want to challenge yourself in learning something new but the project must be finished by the end of the semester.

Do some research and come up with an interesting design concept. Collect your references and inspirations for both design and coding, and post them on your journal. Document everything.

How does working with code change your ideas of graphic design? Think about ways to expand your design. 

Some possibilities are:

- A series of printed generative type posters
- Parametric type design
- A typeface that responds to external data (ie. location, sound, temperature, etc.)
- Sensors to get external environmental data (ie. Arduino board)
- Interactive type posters
- Dynamic identity
- Type patterns generated through code
- Interactive storytelling through type
- A series of book covers generated from your type system
- A publication that uses your computational type system
- Something experimental, something speculative...
- Design for mobile devices/touch interfaces
- Live video input
- Dimensional typography using 3d printer
- What else?

Once you have your design concept, you need to make a first working prototype as quickly as possible. This is to see if it is realistic to pursue your idea, and also to identify which area you should devote your energy on. 

Break down your problems into smaller parts - break them until it is something you can solve. Make more working prototypes. Test. Reflect on it. Iterate and improve. 

Document the whole process. Save versions. Take notes. Take screenshots. Take videos. Organize your materials. Share your process with other people.

_Optionally, you can work as a team (max.2 people) although it is not required. If you are going to work as a team, it must be clear what each person's role is, and I will expect more from you in terms of the amount as well as the quality of the work. You may receive different gradings based on your participation and contribution._

## Requirements

At the end of the project, you will submit:
- Your code
- Any collaterals
- PDF Documentation: The format is up to you. You may use images, text, prototypes and/or video.

## Schedule

### Week 11
project announcement  
prep for the idea/research presentation - bring in a PDF file describing **2 different ideas**  
In your presentation, you must include:
  - sketches
  - inspirations,
  - references,
  - what resources you need
  - a rough weekly schedule

### Week 12
first working prototype presentation - the design/coding may not be polished, but you should demonstrate a simple working prototype.

### Week 13
work in class

### Week 14
mid-review

### Week 15
work in class

### Week 16
final presentation
