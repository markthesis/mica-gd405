# Having problems with your code?

1. **Check the spelling.** l e t t e r b y l e t t e r.

1. **Save often and test often.** Whenever you add a few lines of code, save and preview to make sure everything looks okay.

1. **Identify the problem.** Take your time and look at your code again. Try to find what is causing the problem.
  
1. **Isolate the problem.** Use comments `//` or `/* */` to isolate the problem. Try adding comments to blocks of code so that the browser will skip the commented area. If the problem goes away, then, the problem must be somewhere within the commented area.
  
1. **Organize your code.** When you don't have proper line breaks and bad indentation, it is much harder to find the problem. Before you do anything else, fix the indentation, make it easy to look at your code.

1. **Have another person look at your code.** More often than not, it is a small mistake that is causing the problem. Ask your classmate to look over your code. They will provide a fresh view.
  
1. **Start a new file.** Open up an empty sketch and recreate the problem in the simplest form. Understand how the algorithm works and go back to your code to apply it.
  
1. **Mistyped something?** Go over your code slowly line by line and see if you missed any brackets, parentheses, colons, semicolons, etc. The Brackets code editor warns you with different color coding if it detects the problems. Focus on those areas.
  
1. **Look at the console.** Use `println()` to keep track of variables.

1. **Google it.** There must be other people who had the same problem before.
  
1. **Take a break.** Sometimes, we just need a break.
